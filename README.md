# Platformer Tile Generator

This program was written by [Edward Peters](https://github.com/E-Peters-2205) to fullfil the first contract of the Tinkeing Graphics assignment from Falmouth University's COMP110 module, titled 'Platform Tile Generator'. The aim of the program was to take tile-sized textures and maniputate the pixel colours in order to generate more textures.

## Instructions

Python version 2.7 was used to write this program. Execute the code written in the file 'Generator.py' in order to use the program, making sure the .jpg files are in the same folder at the time.
Once the program is running use the buttons to cycle through the materials available and the conditions they can have applied to them.

## Licensing Information

The MIT license has been applied due to it's simplicity, which I feel is appropriate for a program of this calibre. It will enable wide use of the code while still recognising the original author. This is because a license notice must be included in any copies of the code, including commecial copies.
